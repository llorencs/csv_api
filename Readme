To install the application you need to run the docker compose with the command docker-compose up

The tool has been developd with FastAPI.

To store the information of the CSV files is using a MongoDB database.

I have created 3 endpoints.

- To download the csv:
POST /api/v1/download

With body as JSON:
    - url: The url where the CSV file is located. It requires full path for example: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/drc/terbuthylazin.csv
    - topic: The name of the topic.
    Example of the body:
        {"url": "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/drc/terbuthylazin.csv",
        "topic": "Accidents"
        }

- Filter CSV files by topic
GET /api/v1/files/{topic}
    - Topic of the CSV files to be filtered
    It is case sensitive.

- Get the CSV header of a file
POST /api/v1/header

Body JSON:
    - id (Optional): The ID of the CSV to pull
    - Name (Optional): The name of the CSV that would be something like: terbuthylazin.csv.
    Is required to give the ID or the Name. If they are given both or none it will return an error 400.

Response:
    - It returns a JSON containing the header as an Array and the name and ID of the file.


- Decisions:
    I have decided to store some of the basic information of the CSV in the download operation,
    like storing the header in the database. As it is an information that will be accessed many times,
    And instead of having to read the file every time that this is requested, it is only read the first time
    during the download.

    - To process the header I decided to read it as text file and read the first line of the CSV. Instead of
    using the CSV library.

Spent time:
    - About 2 hours.
